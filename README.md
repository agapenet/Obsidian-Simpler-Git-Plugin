# Obsidian Seamless Git Integration

This project works with Obsidian-Git and just adds a command that saves the file and commits/pushes changes at once, as well as pulls changes when opening the vault. I made this for my own convenience and you should not assume it will cater to your needs, I am not an Obsidian plugin developer nor am I a typescript developer.
